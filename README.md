# fp_eval

The following notebooks evaluate the robustness of two audio fingerprinting algorithms: [chromaprint](https://acoustid.org/chromaprint) and [Qfp](https://github.com/mbortnyck/qfp). The notebooks are self-explanatory and are required to be run in a Google Colab environment. The evaluations have been perfomed under three criteria:
..* Robustness to superimposed noise.
..* Robustness to pitch-shifting.
..* Robustness to time-stretching.

The fingerprinting database has been created using the GTZAN Genre Recognition dataset.
